## **welcome - introduction to using the glitch knit machine**

This is an intro to machine knitting, but not as you know it. One of our fabbers hacked a Brother KH-970 knitting machine, using information from Fab Lab Shibuya in Japan. Rather than using punch-cards, this is a digital process, with intentional glitches in the software.

It was very popular in the 80s - 90s! You can make all kind of fun patterns, kinds of stitches that you can control digitally, & use it to make fun textile objects such as beanies!

This machine used to be driven by punchcards and was hacked to be computer-controlled by Fab Lab Kamakura, Fab Lab Wgtn & another Fab Lab in the US


----------


## **steps to get started on the machine**

1️⃣ make your design

2️⃣ open your design in the software

3️⃣ set up the machine

	3.1 - insert the yarn
	3.2 - do the cast on
	3.3 - check & prepare the carriage
  
4️⃣ do the cast off


----------


## **basics things to know about this glitch knitting machine**

this machine can do 2 yarn colors at a time - called the yarn A & the yarn B
A being your primary color and B being your secondary color

**what material should we use?**
mid-weight yarn is the best
you don't want it not too light or too heavy

**the machine in itself**


  **the bed**

  there are 200 needles
  the center of the machine bed being the 0 one (100 to the left & 100 to the right)
  the position & number of needles you use are very important
  4 positions possible for the needles
  - A - non working position
  - B - primary knitting row
  - D - secondary knitting row (or holes if you don’t have a secondary thread)
  - E - holes

  **the carriage**


  it slides from the left to the right to help us knit our design!

  Here are all its elements:
  - a tension disk (from 1 to 10)
  - a mode selection (options are NL, CR, KC(I) or KC(II))
  - CAM buttons (MC for multi-color for example)
  - CAM button release lever (hit PLAIN to set CAM buttons back to normal)
  - a holding cam lever (options are N for normal or H to hold)
  - a sinker plate with a gate (gate goes into ‘A’ or ‘B’ position)


**but first thing first, you should have a design**

- if you don't have a design yet

	you can create a very simple two-color "check game" design using Paint 
	or just draw a black filled square on white background
	save it as a .jpg

- if you already have a two-color design saved as a.jpg

	you'll just have to drag & drop it into the Glitch Knit machine software!

	then, you should wonder what should be the size of your first sample
	= how many needles you're going to use (remember the bed is 200 needles wide)
	generally, you will position your garment in the middle of the bed


----------


## **step 1 - open your design in the Glitch Knit machine’s software**

![](/images/image_3_image_converter_software.jpg)


⚠️ at this stage, you should make sure the copper board is plugged into the computer


  here is what to do:
  - open Processing software 
  - in Processing, open “Image Converter”
  - in Processing, hit the “play” button 
   

  **→ the glitch knit software should be up & ready!**

  you can now drag & drop your .jpg picture in Image Converter
  each pixel of your design now represent a stitch
  if your 2 colors are black & white, it will turn the image “pixels” into white or black stitches

  with Image Converter, you can: 
  - change the size of your design
  - change the threshold of your pixels/stitches
  - line up your design with the position you want on the bed


----------


## **step 2.1 - insert the yarn**


![](/images/image_4_inserting_yarn.jpg)


insert the yarn in the 5 different areas where it needs to be inserted


- put the yarn in **1st metal loop** on the metal antenna above the glitch knit


- there’s a **white tension wheel** on the metal antenna, put the yarn between the two metal disks


- put the yarn in **3rd metal loop** on the metal antenna above the glitch knit


- put the yarn in **4th metal loop** on the metal antenna above the glitch knit


- and finally put it into the **sinker plate gate to ‘A’ position** and close it (by flicking the white gate opener)


![](/images/image_5_sinker_plate_and_gate_in_A_position.jpg)


----------


## **step 2.2 - make the “cast on”**

set everything 
decide what tension you want (how big the loops will be) with the tension disk 
start a little bit loose by setting it to 4 or 5

![](/images/image_6_cast_on_instructions.jpg)


**→  to make our square, we’re going to use 40 needles today**

here’s how to do a **BY HAND cast on**:


- put the carriage on the right end
- tie off one end of the yarn string to the metal hook under the table
- bring 40 centre needles from the ‘A’ to ‘D’ position 
- open the gates on each needle
- tie a loose knot around the LAST needle on the LEFT side in ‘D’ position
- from left to right, put the yarn thread around each pin

- the tension is very important at this stage
  →   too tight - you’ll have a hard time moving the carriage around
  →   too loose - it can tangle and get caught inside, uneven knit

- the result should look like this:

----------


## **step 2.3 - check & prepare the carriage**

- check the flaps under the carriage
- check the white screws above the sinker plate

- turn the carriage button to CR (carriage release)
- insert the carriage front rail 1st & the back rail 2nd
- turn the carriage button back from CR to NL (normal)
- slide it a few times to make sure it’s sliding properly

- hit the “PLAIN” button to reset the settings
- close the “gate” on the sinker plate

- slide the carriage to the left to make a first line
- hold the yarn down
- push the needles so the yarn stands on the other side of the latch
- slide the carriage to the right  

- after the first row, take the knight white guide bar
- it's to made to pull your job down, keeps a great tension
- hook it onto the first row
- pay attention not to have our yarn thread tangled in it

- do a couple more rows now
- slide to the left, to the right, to the left, to the right and so on

- if your job is quite smaller than the weight bar, add the two metal weight clamps to have a more precise & balanced weight

**-> that’s the basic setup with a single color**


----------


## **if you want to move on & use more than one color**


- turn the carriage button to KC(II) (extends a doofer in the back of the carriage that will hit switches along the way)
- slide from the left end to the right
- at this stage, we only had one thread set, so we created little holes

- now is the right time to set the second color
- and hit the MC button on the carriage head (for multi-colors)
- slide a few times to see if the new color is behaving as wanted
- no need to slide to the extreme end every time (just once so the machine knows the size of the job & position of the carriage)
 
- at some stages, you might want to bring the weight bar closer to the bed again to have a better tension

**wanna go back to single-color?**

- hit the plain button
- take the white yarn off of the carriage head
- change the carriage button to NL
- do a few slides again, to have new layers of black


----------


## **step 4 - do the “cast off”**

 
- 💡 first, read these instructions

## **a bit about the maintenance of the Glitch Knit**

from time to time, it’s good to oil the machine
basically all the importants parts (the moving parts below the carriage + the pins)


----------


## **what you should practice after glitch knitting for the first time**


- inserting the yarn & set everything to neutral
- do the cast on
- change the tension - to change the gages
- make holes
- make ladders
- make holds = "turns" (knitting on one side but not the other)
- make stripes - changing colors
- make jacquard (two colors at a time)
- make puckers
- do the cast off

to run a **workshop** about the Glitch Knit machine, a reasonable goal would be to play around with plain stitching & changing colors to make a small-sized beanie


----------


## **workshop on Glitch Knitting - create a small-sized beanie**

- do the cast on
- do 2 lines holding it down with your hand
- put the weight clamps

- follow a "2 needles in - 1 out - 2 needles in - 1 out" pattern for the mock rib
- do 20 lines with this scheme
- do 1 line with no yarn on
- do 20 lines again with the yarn on

- then new 30 lines
- then take out 1 needle on each side
- do 2 more lines
- take out 1 needle on each side again
- do 2 more line
- follow this pattern until you have 10 needles left

- do the cast off

- iron the hat
- wash it under hot water

- sew it together

- now try to make a adult-sized beanie with your design on it!
